# Welcome to 42cursus-ft_containers!
This repository contains a project of the [42 school].
This project is about reimplementing some standard containers of the C++ standard library.

The containers implemented in this repository are:
- `vector`
- `map`
- `stack`
- `set` _(bonus part)_

## Overview
The general approach is quite simple: the reimplementation has to work exactly the same way as the real one.
However, one is free to choose the type of the tree for the `map`.

If one wants to implement the `set` as a bonus, the use of a Red-Black-Tree is mandatory.

## Approach
_Coming soon!_

### Final notes
